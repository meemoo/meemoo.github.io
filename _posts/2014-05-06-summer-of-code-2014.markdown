Thanks to [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org) I have
[a project](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/automata/5733935958982656)
accepted to
[Google Summer of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014)!
I am so excited and grateful to Mozilla,
[Forrest](http://forresto.com) and the
[NoFlo](http://noflojs.org)/[Flowhub](http://flowhub.io) team! This is
my second time in the program: back in 2012 I was mentored by Forrest
[to work on Meemoo](https://wiki.mozilla.org/SummerOfCode/2012/Meemoo). This
year I will be working under Forrest mentoring again, hacking on both
Meemoo and NoFlo/Flowhub.

[NoFlo](http://noflojs.org) is an open source JavaScript
implementation of
[Flow-Based Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming)
that you can plug in
[many runtimes](http://flowhub.io/documentation/flowhub-faq/#what-runtimeslanguages-are-supported)
like Web browsers, Node.js, GNOME and even Arduino and other
microcontrollers. NoFlo empowers [Flowhub](http://flowhub.io), a
visual programming environment that makes possible to _code without
real code_: like Meemoo, you can code just dragging-and-dropping boxes
and plugging them together with wires.

The GSoC project idea is to implement main existing Meemoo modules as
NoFlo components and subgraphs. Meemoo is strong in 2d drawing and
animation so we will be creating NoFlo components and subgraphs to
canvas 2d rendering. The main repository to follow for updates now is
[noflo-canvas](http://github.com/noflo/noflo-canvas) and we wish to
give some love to other component libraries like
[noflo-tween](https://github.com/djdeath/noflo-tween),
[noflo-webaudio](https://github.com/automata/noflo-webaudio) and an
upcoming _noflo-three_.

You can already give _noflo-canvas_ a try running [this example on Flowhub](http://app.flowhub.io/#example/5f74ae0e1efc6ab52757).

We hope to get many of the
[existing Meemoo apps](http://meemoo.org/hack-our-apps) ported to
NoFlo near the end of this summer and to create brand new ones. We
also like to investigate ways to get Meemoo closer to
[WebMaker](http://webmaker.org) tools: maybe we could use
[MakeAPI](https://github.com/mozilla/MakeAPI) to publish on Mozilla
WebMaker Gallery.

This blog will receive weekly updates about what we are working on, so
please keep following us!
