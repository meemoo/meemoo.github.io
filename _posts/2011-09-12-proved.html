  I have been making proof-of-concepts and alpha versions of this idea since January, so I'm ready to say that I have graduated to working on the alpha version now. I have been working on the UI, which isn't necessarily the best thing to be polishing at the beginning, but I feel like I need to be able to interact with it on a basic level before understanding which features to implement. Creating a web app is more like sculpting clay than marble... you can always add and take away more if needed.
